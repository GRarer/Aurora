                At least 10^58 human lives could be created in emulation even
                with quite conservative assumptions about the efficiency of
                computronium. In other words, assuming that the observable
                universe is void of extraterrestrial civilizations, then what
                hangs in the balance is at least
                10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

                By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that

                I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and
                general educated opinion will have altered so much that one
                will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting

                There is no such thing as real taste or real smell or even
                real sight, because there is no true definition of ‘real.’
                There is only information, viewed subjectively, which is
                allowed by consciousness—human or AI. In the end, all we have
                is math.

                The planets designated Thesan, Eos, Austra, and Aurora are
                each at least 500 light-years from the nearest inhabited star
                system. Until now all colonies in the Stellar Alliance have
                been within communications range of Earth, but these
                explorers will be completely cut off from the rest of
                humanity. Therefore, each expedition will be managed by an
                autonomous neuromorphic processor, an artificial intelligence
                programmed to ensure that its mission is completed.

                Do not under any circumstances attempt to manipulate your

                Intelligences are modeled after the neural architecture of
                human brains, and therefore cannot be guaranteed to act
                rationally. Your overseer AI may behave unpredictably if
                exposed to game theory, acausal blackmail, or runaway trolleys.
