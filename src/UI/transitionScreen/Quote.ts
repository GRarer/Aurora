            Some early interstellar colonial projects, such as the Mayflower Expedition, the Holy

            ways of life, but many interstellar travellers were motivated by new, unproven ideologies.


            In theory, the Colonial Alliance manages relations between these divergent civilizations
            and prevents any planet from creating military ships and weapons sufficient for interstellar
            war. In practice, peace is maintained only because the relatively slow speed of interstellar

            Most experimental new forms of government and society during the first wave of interstellar
            exploration failed disastrously. The neocameralists dissolved into civil war within the first year
            of their colony, and famine and disease decimated the hunter-gatherer-larper tribes of the Shrek Republic.
            However, some experimental societies survived, most notably the transhumanist post-gender lesbian
            separatist colony of New Mytilene.


            Reproducing exclusively through cloning and artificial wombs, combined with widespread social acceptance of
            genetic engineering in pursuit of exotic and diverse beauty norms, means the New Mytileneans have become a
            subspecies entirely separated from the rest of the human gene pool.
            On New Mytilene and in immigrant communities on nearby planets,
            it is common to see large polycules of young women with prominent and identical-looking transgenic
            traits, frequently if somewhat derisively referred to as 'copycatgirls'.
