/**
 * A 'type A = Newtype<N, T>' is like a type synonym 'type A = T', but it
 * creates a distinct type 'A' with the same runtime representation as 'T'. That
 * is, it is a compile error to use a value of type 'A' in place of a value of
 * type 'T' and vice-versa, but the type has no boxing overhead, as it only
 * exists at compile-time.
 *
 * In order to make a new newtype, declare it as follows:
 *
 *   type Int = Newtype<{ readonly Int: unique symbol; }, number>;
 *
 * This declares 'Int' as a distinct type with the same representation as
 * 'number'. In order to convert between the two types, you need an isomorphism:
 *
 *   // Make the newtype converter
 *   const Int: NewtypeWrapper<Int> = newtype();
 *
 *   // Wrap a 'number' into an 'Int'
 *   const anInt: Int = Int.wrap(3);
 *
 *   // Unwrap an 'Int' into a 'number'
 *   const aNumber: number = Int.unwrap(anInt);
 *
 *   // Error! Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'Int'
 *   const error: Int = aNumber;
 *
 * Using this strategy, the type and the converter can both have the same name.
