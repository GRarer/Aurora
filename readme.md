# Aurora

Aurora is a game about space colonization, artificial intelligence, and
eschatology.

This project is lead by Grace Rarer as part of Georgia Tech's VGDev club.

## How to build and run locally

To build the project, run `npm run build` from a terminal. If you don't have
Typescript installed, run `npm install` to install it locally, or `npm install
-g typescript` to install it globally.

To test the program locally, you need to start a local server and then navigate
to `http://localhost:<port#>/index.html`. To do this, run `npm run start &` to
start a server running in the background. To make it work, you'll need to
install the developer dependencies using Node via `npm install`. After starting
the server, you do not need to restart it after each build; it will reload
automatically.
